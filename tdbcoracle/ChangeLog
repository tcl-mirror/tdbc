	NOTE THAT TDBCORACLE REMAINS "PROOF OF CONCEPT" CODE NOT FOR RELEASE

2010-06-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>:
	
	* Makefile.in:			Revised the code at the suggestion
	* generic/tdbcoracle.c:		of Andreas Kupries to avoid using
					'tcl_findLibrary' and instead execute
					both 'source' and 'load' commands from
					'pkgIndex.tcl'. Revised the 'make test'
					rule, and the test scripts, to
					test successfully under the new regime.
					Thanks to Andreas for providing the
					original patch, and to Joe English
					for providing ideas for simplifying
					and repairing 'make test' under the
					new regime.
