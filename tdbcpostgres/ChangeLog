	* configure (New file): autoconf 2.59
		(Added pre-built 'configure' so that TEA users don't
		need autoconf, m4 and all that stuff pre-installed)
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:   Many changes to upgrade to Tcl Engineering
	* library/tdbcpostgres.tcl: Manual conventions and correct memory
	* tests/current.test:       mismanagement. Introduced a workaround
			            for a suspected bug in Tcl_SubstObj.
