	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: Moved the int32_t/int16_t types into the
	  _WIN32 conditional. Conflicted with HPUX own definitions of
	  these types and required only for windows.

	* aclocal.m4:	Synchronized with tdbc.
	* configure.in:	Advanced version number to 1.0b15. Advanced TEA

			are located on VC++.
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: 
			Corrected a number of errors and warnings in the
			VC++ build.
	* README:	Advanced to 1.0b15
	* tclconfig/:	Advanced to TEA 3.7

	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: Fixed violations of strict C89.
	* Makefile.in: Removed attempt to generate a stub library. Drivers
	  do not export stub tables.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* generic/fakepq.h (new file):
	* generic/pqStubDefs.txt (new file):
	* generic/pqStubInit.c (new file):
	* generic/pqStubs.h (new file):
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: 
		Modified to load libpq using Tcl_LoadFile and not
		link to its client library, nor include the standard
		pq-fe headers. This change allows tdbc::postgres to
		build when the build system lacks a PostgreSQL installation.

	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:   Many changes to upgrade to Tcl Engineering
	* library/tdbcpostgres.tcl: Manual conventions and correct memory
	* tests/current.test:       mismanagement. Introduced a workaround
