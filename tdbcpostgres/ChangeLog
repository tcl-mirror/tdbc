	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: 
		Modified to load libpq using Tcl_LoadFile and not
		link to its client library, nor include the standard
		pq-fe headers. This change allows tdbc::postgres to
		build when the build system lacks a PostgreSQL installation.

2009-09-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure (New file): autoconf 2.59

		need autoconf, m4 and all that stuff pre-installed)
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:   Many changes to upgrade to Tcl Engineering
	* library/tdbcpostgres.tcl: Manual conventions and correct memory
	* tests/current.test:       mismanagement. Introduced a workaround
