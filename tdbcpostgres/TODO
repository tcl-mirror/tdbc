Issues:
 
-timeout configuration option now only sets connect_timeout option for PGconnect(), so the value
has now nothing to do with timeouts during operation (only with connection process to server). It's left as 
readonly for now, but needs some improval or renaming. 

-check if QueryConnectionOption for isolations doesn't need ToLower ot ToUpper.

-check if connection columns return valid fields.

-use hashmap for types

-write actual comment intro for ConnectionConfigureMethod

Not to forget:
README needs to be written.
doc/ needs to be written.
