	* generic/fakesql.h:
			Corrected syntax of INSTAPI specifiers.
	* generic/odbcStubDefs.txt:
			Added a CONVENTION: SQL_API line so that 
			genExtStubs.tcl can get the syntax right on the
			pointer-to-function declarations.
	* generic/odbcStubInit.txt:
			Corrected syntax of INSTAPI specifiers. Regenerated.
	* generic/odbcStubs.h:
			Regenerated.

2010-05-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Makefile.in: Removed attempt to generate a stub library. Drivers
	  do not export stub tables.

2010-04-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in: Added missing files to 'make dist.' Added a 'genstubs'
	               rule to automate building of the Stubs table from the
		       ODBC library added at run time.
	* generic/fakesql.h:
	* generic/odbcStubDefs.txt:
	* generic/odbcStubInit.c:
		Fixed DOS line endings.
	
2010-04-25  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in:
	* README:       Advance version to 1.0b14
	* configure:    autoconf 2-59
	
2010-04-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:  Added code to specify to 'make test' and 'make shell'
	                the value of TDBC_LIBRARY, needed for
	                [package require tdbc] to work. This library is
	                either the 'library' subdirectory of the TDBC source
	                directory (when running from an un-installed TDBC)
	                or else the TDBC library directory in the installed
	                Tcl.
	* configure: autoconf 2.59
	
2010-04-08  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Revised TDBC_ names to be tdbc_, because that's
	what TEA_LOAD_CONFIG does. Added a check to find 'tdbc.h' in the
	build directory if necessary.
	
	* configure: autoconf 2.59.
	
2010-03-17  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/odbcStubInit.c: Revised TIP 357 API yet again, adding a
	'flags' parameter to Tcl_LoadFile.
	
2010-03-15  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/odbcStubInit.c: Adjusted to revised TIP 357 API.
	
2010-03-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Removed all dependency on the native ODBC headers
	and import libraries. All ODBC references are now resolved at
	run time and contained in a 'fakesql.h' file. Removed references to
	Tk as well.
	* configure: autoconf-2.59
	* generic/fakesql.h (new file): Added file containing declarations
	of all ODBC API's used in this package, to avoid dependence on native
	headers.
	* generic/odbcStubsDefs.txt (new file): Declarations of functions
	imported from odbc32.dll using Tcl_LoadLibrary.
	* generic/odbcStubInit.c (new file): Code to load odbc32.dll and
	odbccp32.dll and initialize Stubs tables with the routines in them
	that are used in tdbc::odbc.
	* generic/odbcStubs.h (new file): Generated .h file with the Stubs
	structure defined in generic/odbcStubsDefs.txt.
	* tdbcodbc.c: Updated to use run-time-loaded ODBC libraries instead
	of associating to system headers at compile time and import libraries
	at link time. Revised handling of the '-parent' option so that the
	dependence on Tk is only at run time.
	
2009-09-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:		Changed 'test' rule to test all available
				database types.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:	Changed all TEST_* env vars to TDBCODBC_*
				for easier top-level scripting.  Clarified
				and expanded database type selection.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:   Replaced SQLSetConnectAttr with the obsolete
				SQLSetConnectOption, for better compatibility
				with older ODBC drivers.
	
2009-09-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advance version number to 1.0b13
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59
	
2009-07-02  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:		Added testing on SQL Server Express so that
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: 	more functionality and data types can be
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:	exposed.  Added code to force column names
				in result sets to be unique. 
	
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl: Conditioned use of the IS_NULLABLE hack
	                        on the driver's not returning the NULLABLE
	                        flag in [$db columns]. This conditional
	                        fixes bug 3e523335bb, which fails when
				IS_NULLABLE is padded to a fixed length with
	 			spaces.
	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b12
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59
	
2009-05-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:	
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b11
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (GetCell): Corrected a problem where
	results longer than the preallocated buffer length had spurious
	NULL characters inserted. Corrected a subsequent problem where
	BLOBs had *missing* characters. (The ODBC documentation lies about
	terminating NULL bytes.)
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (odbc-27.[12]): Corrected a problem where
	BLOB and MEMO tests didn't actually test anything.
	Thanks to Alan Grunwald for reporting these bugs
	
2009-04-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_odbc.n: Added missing documentation for 'new' constructors.
	
2009-04-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_odbc.n: Made changes so that NROFF formatting matches
	                   the Tcl standard.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Changed so that all variable access failures
			      are mapped to NULL rather than passing errors
			      throught the interp.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Adjusted test cases for inappropriate access
			       to array variables.
	
2009-04-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:	
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b10
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

2009-03-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl: Replaced 'my variable' with variables at
	class level.  Replaced 'init' methods with constructors implemented
	in C.  Replaced 'statementClass' and 'resultSetClass' variables
	with forwarded 'statementCreate' and 'resultSetCreate' methods.
	
2009-02-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:	
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b9
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

	* Makefile.in: Removed useless TCL_VERSION_REQ test in the
	               pkgIndex.tcl.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (GetCell): 
		Fixed bad bug in retrieving LONGVARCHAR, LONGVARBINARY,
		CLOB, BLOB, etc. (The SQL_NO_TOTAL return was not being
		handled, resulting in infinite loops, memory corruption,
		or NULLS in place of the actual data.)
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-27.1):
		Added a test case for the above bug.
		Thanks to Patrick Dunnigan for the bug report.
	
2009-02-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in:
	* README:		Advance verwsion to 1.0b8
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59
	
	* doc/tdbc_odbc.n:	Formatting changes so that man2html works.

	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-26.1):
				Removed superfluous difference between
				SQLite and non-SQLite tests - all now
				return the same SQLSTATE.
	
2009-02-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (StatementInitMethod): Corrected a bad check
	that caused SQLDescribeParam to be bypassed entirely. Corrected
	bad code that was exposed by this fix (SQLDescribeParam failure was
	handled incorrectly). Corrected the error code for variables in	
	native SQL syntax.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Corrected error codes for seven tests, to
	match the [try]-friendly error code syntax.
	
2009-01-31  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:	Advanced version to 1.0b7
	* configure.in:
	* configure:	autoconf 2.59
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Revised error codes to be more [try]-friendly.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Added test cases for revised error codes,
	and for an uncovered branch in ODBC statement error handling.

	* generic/tdbodbc.c:     Added "tdbc::odbc::datasources" and
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl:  "tdbc::odbc::drivers" for inspection of 
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:   available databases.
	
2008-12-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Added '-encoding' and -timeout' options.
	Added direct transfer (rather than stringization) of parameters
	of integer and floating point types.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-19.*): Added rudimentary
	configuration tests, and rudimentary tests of direct value
	transfers C <-> SQL.
	
2008-11-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Changed PACKAGE_NAME to lowercase 'tdbcodbc'
			Changed PACKAGE_VERSION to 0.2a1
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: 
			Look in a few additional places for dependent packages.
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl: Lowercased the 'tdbc' package and advanced the
	                        version number on which tdbcodbc depends.
			        Added code to detect whether the connection
	                        supports Unicode.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Added '-isolation' and '-readonly' configuration
		              options. Added code to use Unicode if possible
			      for columns of unknown type and wide-character
			      columns. Changed the script-level package name
			      to tdbc::odbc.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Changed the script-level package name to
			       tdbc::odbc. Renamed all tests accordingly.

	* configure.in: Changed configurator so that 8.6 no longer requires a
	dummy tclooConfig.h.
	* configure: Autoconf 2.61
	
2008-06-15  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: 
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Removed the default check for Tk. Instead,
	added a '-parent window' option to the constructor of
	tdbc::odbc::connection that gives a parent window for the
	driver manager dialog.
	Added a 'configure' method to the connection object, and
	rudimentary tests. (No configuration options yet implemented)
	
2008-06-11  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>
	
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Split [$resultset nextrow] into two primitive
	methods: [$resultset nextlist] and [$resultset nextdict]. Refactored
	a little bit of the code that handles result sets.

2008-05-24  Kevin B Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Changed configuration to use TEA_PATH_CONFIG to
	* aclocal.m4:   locate tcloo and tdbc.  Removed the local code that 
	                did it from aclocal.m4.
	* configure:    Autoconf 2.61
	
2008-05-13  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile (deleted): Removed a superfluous file from an
		earlier stage of development.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (TablesStmtInitMethod,ResultSetNextrowMethod): 
		Removed a cut-and-paste error in TablesStmtInitMethod that
		caused a pointer smash, and added a cast to silence a gcc
		warning. Changed the 'init2' method on the 'statement'
		class back to 'init' now that TclOO seems to be getting
		method resolution correct.
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl (tdbc::sqlite::statement constructor):
		Changed the 'init2' method on 'statement' back to 
		'init' now that TclOO seems to be getting method resolution
		correct.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Corrected misnumbering of tests, and added
		code to remove the test database on startup to avoid running
		with old data if a previous test run aborted.
	
2008-05-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbcodbc-9.9): Corrected invalid test numbering.
