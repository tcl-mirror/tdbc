Issues:

$statement paramtype - stubbed out
Duplicate column names in result set - need to test.
$statement params - not implemented
Section 19 tests - need to revise for MySQL and code coverage

mysql-18.3 fails - params stubbed out
mysql-20.1 fails - wtf?
mysql-21.2 fails - need varbinary handling

man page needs to be written - it's cloned from tdbcodbc
README needs to be written - it's cloned from tdbcodbc
Makefile needs to be updated, at the very least to handle `make dist`
