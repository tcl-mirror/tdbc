	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Silenced a compiler warning about 'fields'
	                       being used uninitialized.
	* doc/tdbc_mysql.n: Added missing documentation for 'new' constructors.

2009-04-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Changed so that an inappropriate access to
	                       an array or a failing read trace yields NULL.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Revised test cases according to the above 
				change.
	* doc/tdbc_mysql.n: Made changes so that NROFF formatting matches
	                    the Tcl standard.

	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advance version number to 1.0b10
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Reworked the allocation of result buffers
			       so that they belong to the result set and
			       are not allocated per row. Pushed binding the
	                       results up before mysql_stmt_execute,
	                       avoiding a crash if the same statement handle
	                       has been used before [Ticket 39a78606aa].
			       No update made to test suite because
			       valgrind detected the error with existing
			       tests on a -DPURIFY build.

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c:
	* library/tdbcmysql.tcl: Replaced 'init' methods with constructors
	written in C.  Added 'statementCreate' and 'resultSetCreate' forwarding
	in place of the 'statementClass' and 'resultSetClass' variables.
	Removed some classes that were the result of overeager copying
	from tclodbc. Replaced 'my variable' with variables declared at
	class level.

	* doc/tdbc_mysql.n:	Many small format changes to make 'man2html'
				work.

2009-02-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: 
	* configure.in: Changed the <my_global.h> tests to use the
	correct conditionals on mingw.

2009-01-31  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:
	* configure.in: Advanced version to 1.0b7.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Revised errorCode generation to be
	more [try]-friendly. Changed include to <mysql/mysql.h> so that
	the include path isn't necessary.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Added test flags so that a nonstandard port
	or socket can be specified. Changed errorCode-dependent tests to
	look for the new form of errorCode.

	of the 'tdbcodbc' package. Added installation and distribution code.
	* configure.in: Advanced version to 1.0b5
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Added code to track the declared data types
	of parameters and the actual data types of results. Added code to
	do direct binary conversions of integers, floating point numbers,
	and bit strings. Added checks for binary data on results.
	Added disambiguation of duplicated colmn names.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Revised test cases to include all the
	MySQL data types handled in this driver. Added a test case that
	column names are correctly disambiguated.
	* configure: autoconf 2.59
