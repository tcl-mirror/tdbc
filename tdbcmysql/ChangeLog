	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Added code to track the declared data types
	of parameters and the actual data types of results. Added code to
	do direct binary conversions of integers, floating point numbers,
	and bit strings. Added checks for binary data on results.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Revised test cases to include all the
	MySQL data types handled in this driver.
